# Submarine Operator Deployment Guide

- Installs the Cloud Native Machine Learning Platform [Apache Submarine](https://submarine.apache.org/)

## Debugging the Chart

To debug the chart with the release name `submarine`:

```shell
# lint
helm lint ./helm-charts/submarine
# dry-run command
helm install --dry-run --debug submarine ./helm-charts/submarine -n submarine
# or template command
helm template --debug submarine ./helm-charts/submarine -n submarine
```

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `submarine`:

```shell
# create namespace
export NAMESPACE=submarine
kubectl create namespace ${NAMESPACE}

# We have also integrated seldon-core install by helm, thus we need to update our dependency.
helm dependency update ./helm-charts/submarine

# Install submarine operator in namespace submarine
helm install submarine ./helm-charts/submarine --set seldon-core-operator.istio.gateway=${NAMESPACE}/seldon-gateway -n ${NAMESPACE}
```

## Upgrading the Chart

To upgrade the chart with the release name `submarine`:

```shell
helm upgrade submarine ./helm-charts/submarine -n submarine
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `subamrine` deployment:

```shell
helm uninstall subamrine -n submarine
```

## Upgrading an existing Release to a new major version

A major chart version change (like v0.8.0 -> v1.0.0) indicates that there is an
incompatible breaking change needing manual actions.

### To 0.8.0

This version requires Helm >= 3.1.0.
This version is a major change, we migrated `traefik` to `istio` and upgraded the `operator`. You need to backup the database and redeploy.

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the MySQL chart and their default values.
